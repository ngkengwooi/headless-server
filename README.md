# Headless Server

This repository contains the setup scripts and documentation for a headless server. It is for my own use and reference only. Contributions are welcome but I cannot provide any assurance regarding the suitability of these scripts for any systems other than the ones I wrote them for. Use them at your own risk.

## Host system

These scripts have been written for Debian 13 (Trixie).

## Usage

Setup scripts are named in the setup directory. Scripts to be copied to the host system are in the host directory and structured according to their intended locations on the host file system.
